Li et al. [16] demonstrate that by carefully crafting questions using function- level behavior and summaries, LLMs can assist in removing false positives from a bug finding tool. Li et al. [17] also introduce a technique for combining static analysis using symbolic execution with LLMs to find Use Before Initialization (UBI) bugs, demonstrating that the LLM can be used to extract some program semantics and filter out false positives caused by the imprecision of the static analysis. Wen et al. [29] also demonstrate success in removing false positive warnings by using customized questions with domain knowledge from the Juliet [12] benchmark.
